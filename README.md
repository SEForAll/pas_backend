Backend has all the functionality code for program analysis. There are three main chunk of code in this repository. 
1. Database (located in 'databasefiles' folder)
2. Grading system code (located in 'grading_system_helper' folder)
3. Grading system interface (located in 'TestCases' folder)

## Directory Maintenance

- There are lots of duplicate files, please remove duplicates and condense into one file per filename. If you find 
    yourself duplicating files, you should create a branch instead.
- No filenames should have spaces. Use snake_case for file names.
- Fill in this readme to describe (at a high level) what each file/folder is used for.


## Database Maintenance

- Frontend is maintaining OAUTH data for users, so backend should remove models
related to OAUTH and have just one table to store user ID.
- Consider consolidating databases and filesystem with frontend--this may make submission processing easier.
