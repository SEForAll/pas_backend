## Directory Maintenance

- There are lots of duplicate files, please remove duplicates and condense into one file per filename. If you find 
    yourself duplicating files, you should create a branch instead.
- No filenames should have spaces. Use snake_case for file names.
- Fill in this readme to describe (at a high level) what each file/folder is used for.
