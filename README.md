Backend

## Directory Maintenance

- There are lots of duplicate files, please remove duplicates and condense into one file per filename. If you find 
    yourself duplicating files, you should create a branch instead.
- No filenames should have spaces. Use snake_case for file names.
- Fill in this readme to describe (at a high level) what each file/folder is used for.


## Database Maintenance

- Frontend is maintaining OAUTH data for users, so backend should remove models
related to OAUTH and have just one table to store user ID.
- Consider consolidating databases and filesystem with frontend--this may make submission processing easier.
